# An example of note taking
A Nibbleblog install potentially vulnerable to an authenticated file upload vulnerability

An admin portal at nibbleblog/admin.php

Directory listing which confirmed that admin is a valid username

Login brute-forcing protection blacklists our IP address after too many invalid login attempts. This takes login brute-forcing with a tool such as Hydra off the table

# Enumeration recap - can be used in reporting
We started with a simple nmap scan showing two open ports

Discovered an instance of Nibbleblog

Analyzed the technologies in use using whatweb

Found the admin login portal page at admin.php

Discovered that directory listing is enabled and browsed several directories

Confirmed that admin was the valid username

Found out the hard way that IP blacklisting is enabled to prevent brute-force login attempts

Uncovered clues that led us to a valid admin password of nibbles

# iterative enumeration, along with detailed notetaking, is one of the keys to success
